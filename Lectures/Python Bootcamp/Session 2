Session 2 - Python Objects and data structure basics
-----------------------------------------------------

***** Introduction to python data types
- Basic Data types
Integers
Floating point
strings
lists
Dictionaries
Tuples
sets
booleans


***** Numbers
There are two main number types we will work with
- Integers which are whole numbers
- Floating point numbers which are numbers with a 
decimal
- Lets explore basic math with python
- We will also discuss how to create variables and 
assign them values.


***** Variable assignments
- We just saw how to work with numbers, but what do these
numbers represent
- It would be nice to assign these data types a variable name to easily reference them later on in our code
- For example
mu_dogs = 2

- Rules for variable names
Names can not start with a number
There can be no spaces in the name, use '_' instead
Can't use any of these symbols (:::,<>/>|()!@#$%^&*~-+)
It is considered best practise (PEP8) that names are lowercase
Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like
"list" and "str"

We can dynamically assign variables with different data type values.

Pros of Dynamic typing
- Very easy to work with
- Faster development time

Cons of Dynamic typing
- May result in bugs for unexpected data types
- You need to be aware of type()


***** strings
Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of 
either single quotes or double quotes
- 'hello'
- "Hello"
- "I dont do that"

- Because strings are ordered sequences it means we can using 
indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the strings

- Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string (or variable)
assigned the string.)

- Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the 
string.

- These actions use [] square brackets and a number index
to indicate positions of what you with to grab

Character: h e l l o
Index:     0 1 2 3 4
Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1

- Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple
characters, a "slice" of the string.

- This has the following syntax:
[start:stop:step]

- Start is a numerical index for the slice start.

- Stop is the index you will go up to (but not include)

- Step is the size of the jump you take


***** String indexing and Slicing


***** String properties and methods
Immutability - String does not allow item re-assignement.

1. Are strings mutable?
Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string)

2. How do I create comments in my code?
You can use the hashtag # to create comments in your code
