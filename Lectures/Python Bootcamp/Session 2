Session 2 - Python Objects and data structure basics
-----------------------------------------------------

***** Introduction to python data types
- Basic Data types
Integers
Floating point
strings
lists
Dictionaries
Tuples
sets
booleans


***** Numbers
There are two main number types we will work with
- Integers which are whole numbers
- Floating point numbers which are numbers with a 
decimal
- Lets explore basic math with python
- We will also discuss how to create variables and 
assign them values.


***** Variable assignments
- We just saw how to work with numbers, but what do these
numbers represent
- It would be nice to assign these data types a variable name to easily reference them later on in our code
- For example
mu_dogs = 2

- Rules for variable names
Names can not start with a number
There can be no spaces in the name, use '_' instead
Can't use any of these symbols (:::,<>/>|()!@#$%^&*~-+)
It is considered best practise (PEP8) that names are lowercase
Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like
"list" and "str"

We can dynamically assign variables with different data type values.

Pros of Dynamic typing
- Very easy to work with
- Faster development time

Cons of Dynamic typing
- May result in bugs for unexpected data types
- You need to be aware of type()


***** strings
Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of 
either single quotes or double quotes
- 'hello'
- "Hello"
- "I dont do that"

- Because strings are ordered sequences it means we can using 
indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the strings

- Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string (or variable)
assigned the string.)

- Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the 
string.

- These actions use [] square brackets and a number index
to indicate positions of what you with to grab

Character: h e l l o
Index:     0 1 2 3 4
Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1

- Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple
characters, a "slice" of the string.

- This has the following syntax:
[start:stop:step]

- Start is a numerical index for the slice start.

- Stop is the index you will go up to (but not include)

- Step is the size of the jump you take


***** String indexing and Slicing


***** String properties and methods
Immutability - String does not allow item re-assignement.

1. Are strings mutable?
Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string)

2. How do I create comments in my code?
You can use the hashtag # to create comments in your code


***** Print formatting with strings

- Often you will want to "inject" a variable into your string for printing.
For example:
my_name = Jose
print("Hello" + my_name)

- There are multiple ways to format strings for printing variables in them.

- This is known as string interpolation.

- Lets explore two methods for this:
.format() method
f-strings (formatted string literals)

***** Print Formatting FAQS

1.) I imported print from the __future__ module, now print isn't working. What happened?

This is because once you import from the __future__ module in Python 2.7, a print statement will no longer work, and print must then use a print() function. Meaning that you must use

print('Whatever you were going to print')

or if you are using some formatting:

print('This is a string with an {p}'.format(p='insert'))

The __future__ module allows you to use Python3 functionality in a Python2 environment, but some functionality is overwritten (such as the print statement, or classic division when you import division).

Since we are using Jupyter Notebooks, once you so the import, all cells will require the use if the print() function. You will have to restart Python or start a new notebook to regain the old functionality back.

About this course


***** Lists in Python
- Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types.

- They use [] brackets and commas to separate objects in the
list
[1,2,3,4,5]

- Lists support indexing and slicing. Lists can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called
off of them.


***** Lists FAQ

1. How do I index a nested list? For example if I want to grab 2 from [1,1,[1,2]]?

You would just add another set of brackets for indexing the nested list, for example: my_list[2][1] . We'll discover later on more nested objects and you will be quizzed on them later!


***** Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered mappings for storing objects.
Previously we saw how lists store objects in an ordered sequence.

- This key-value pair allows users to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location.

- Dictionaries use curly braces and colons to signify the keys and their associated values.

{key1:value1,key2:value2}

- So when to choose a list and when to choose a dictionary?
Dictionaries: Objects retrieved by key name. Unordered and can not be sorted.

Lists: Objects retreived by location. Ordered sequence can be indexed or sliced.

Dictionaries FAQ

1. Do dictionaries keep an order? How do I print the values of the dictionary in order?

Dictionaries are mappings and do not retain order! If you do want the capabilities of a dictionary but you would like ordering as well, check out the ordereddict object lecture later on in the course!


***** Tuples with Python
Tuples are very similar to lists. However they have one key 
difference - Immutability

Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned.

Tuples use parenthesis(1,2,3)


***** Sets in Python
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

Meaning there can only be one representative of the same
object


***** Booleans in Python
Booleans are operators that allow you to convey True or False
These are very important later on when we deal with control
flow and logic.

Resources for More Basic Practice
Before you begin your assessment, I wanted to point out some helpful links for practice (don't worry about being able to do these exercises, I just want you to be aware of the links so you can visit them later, since we still haven't discussed functions, you won't be able to utilize a lot of these resources yet!):
